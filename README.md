# ViT-YOLO11-Wildfire-Detection
This repository provides links to the datasets used in my fire detection research, including a standard fire vision dataset, the synthetic M4SFWD dataset, and the real-time D-Fire dataset. These datasets support model training, evaluation, and benchmarking for fire and smoke detection.
